# Water-Quality-Testing-Analysis-and-Prediction
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a water quality analysis and prediction project, which serves as the final project for the "Supervised Machine Learning: Classification" course, part of the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze water quality parameters and predict water potability based on a provided dataset. The repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in water quality analysis and machine learning for classification.
